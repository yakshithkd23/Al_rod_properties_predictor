# Al_proparties_prediction

he target values that need to be predicted from the given dataset and problem statement are the final wire rod properties, specifically:

Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)

Elongation

Conductivity

These properties are influenced by various dynamic parameters such as casting temperature, cooling water temperature and pressure, casting speed, emulsion temperature and pressure, quench water pressure, etc.

Objective of Prediction Model:
The goal is to build a real-time prediction system that can analyze the casting parameters and predict UTS, Elongation, and Conductivity before the production completes. This will help in adjusting parameters in real time to achieve the desired wire rod properties without relying on post-production testing.
